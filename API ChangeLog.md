ISAAC-Rest Changelog 

Any time a code change is made that impacts the API returned to callers, increment the value in API ChangeLog.md, and in RestSystemInfo

During development, we can increment this, so long as our client code (komet) is aware of the changes.

After an official release, any API change should be done by bumping the major version - and creating new rest paths (/rest/2/, /rest/write/2/)
If reverse compatibility is required to be maintained, then the rest/1 or rest/write/1 code must remain.

* 2016/10/10 - 1.5.3 - Removing user id from wf parameters and parameter DTO, replacing with calls to RequestInfo.getEditCoordinate().  All relevant edit and workflow REST APIs now accept only editToken parameter, which can now be created and retrieved only by calling CoordinateAPIs.getEditToken() with ssoToken and/or editToken parameters, along with additional documented optional parameters
* 2016/10/10 - 1.5.2 - Add an API for reading a specific association description.  Integrating fortify fixes (shouldn't cause any API / behavior change)  
* 2016/10/06 - 1.5.1 - Adding Association APIs.  Cleaned up the returned pagination data, so that it stops returning page links that don't make 
    sense when you are at the first or last page.  Added a field to pagination data to indicate if the approximateTotal is an estimate, or exact.
    Fixed a regression in the json serializer that was leading to the serialization of null fields - null fields are no longer serialized.
* 2016/10/03 - 1.5.0 - Getting rid of "...Versions" api classes that were confusing wrappers.  Changing return types to Array instead.  Specific 
    API changes are below that will break compatibility...
    * Removals
      * RestSememeDescriptionVersions (This probably wasn't used in Komet)
      * RestStrings (couldn't find any use)
      * RestUUIDs
      * RestCommentVersions
      * RestMappingItemVersions
      * RestMappingSetVersions
      * RestWorkflowAvailableActions
      * RestWorkflowDefiniationDetails (couldn't find any use)
      * RestWorkflowProcesses (couldn't find any use)
      * RestWorkflowProcessHistories
      * RestWorkflowProcoessHistoriesMap
    * Renames
      * RestSearchResults -> RestSearchResultPage - the internal RestSearchResult list changed to a RestSearchResult[]
      * RestSememeVersions -> RestSememeVersionPage - the internal RestSememeVersion list changed to a RestSememeVersion[]
    * More details on the replacement of certain removed items:
      * 1/comments/byReferencedComponent now returns RestCommentVersion[] instead of RestCommentVersions
      * 1/sememe/byReferencedComponent now returns RestSememeVersion[] instead of a list (doesn't change json or xml representation)
      * 1/concept/descriptions now returns RestSememeDescriptionVersion[] instead of a list (may not change json representation)
      * 1/mapping/mappingSets changes from RestMappingSetVersions to RestMappingSetVersion[]
      * 1/mapping/mappingItems changes from RestMappingItemVersions to RestMappingItemVersion[]
      * 1/workflow/historiesForProcess changes from RestWorkflowProcessHistories to RestWorkflowProcessHistory[]
      * 1/workflow/advanceableProcessInformation changes from RestWorkflowProcessHistoriesMap to RestWorkflowProcessHistoriesMapEntry[]
      * 1/workflow/actionsForProcessAndUser changes from RestWorkflowAvailableActions to RestWorkflowAvailableAction[]


* 2016/10/01 - 1.4.10 - Changing componentToIntitialEditMap in RestWorkflowProcess to be Set of RestWorkflowComponentNidToInitialEditEpochMapEntry to avoid 
    Enunciate errors
* 2016/09/26 - 1.4.9 - Adding WorkflowAPIs getDefaultDefinition() and getAvailableDefinitions()
* 2016/09/26 - 1.4.8 - Removing preferred term and acceptable dialects from RestConceptCreateData, changing field names in RestConceptCreateData, changing 
    getDescriptionExtendedTypeConceptId() to return Integer rather than int 
* 2016/09/26 - 1.4.7 - Fixing bug causing incorrect paths for WorkflowWriteAPIs REST methods, sorted comments by time, fixed a bug in reading / parsing
    mapset entries.  Limited mapset entries to 1000, until we get the API switched to paging.
* 2016/09/19 - 1.4.6 - Adding description extended type to DTOs and populating in SememeAPIs, modifying workflow APIs to eliminate Enunciate errors caused by use of Map
* 2016/09/15 - 1.4.5 - Tweaking some aspects of mapset / map item APIs (adding fields, changing return type from int to UUID on create/edit)
* 2016/09/01 - 1.4.4 - Added ConceptWriteAPIs and replaced exposed OCHRE State enum with REST RestStateType. Also lowered visibility of DTO fields
* 2016/08/24 - 1.4.3 - Lots of workflow API stubs have been added, refactoring Rest APIs for mapping to fix design problems.
* 2016/07/25 - 1.4.2 - Adding Mapping / Comment APIs
* 2016/06/01 - 1.4.1 - Changed return value of SystemAPIs.getIdentifiedObjects() to return RestIdentifiedObjectsResult rather than List<Object>.
* 2016/05/16 - 1.4.0 - Renamed SystemInfo to RestSystemInfo for consistency.
* 2016/05/16 - 1.3.3 - Added a boolean field 'isConceptDefined' to RestConceptVersion.  Removed isaacGuiVersion, assemblyVersion
  and metadataVersion from SystemInfo, as they made no sense.
* 2016/05/16 - 1.3.2 - Change restVersion to apiImplementationVersion
* 2016/05/13 - 1.3.1 - Add restVersion to SystemInfo
* 2016/05/10 - 1.3 - Add the class 'RestCoordinates' a composed of all REST coordinate types to be returned by getCoordinates()
* 2016/05/05 - 1.2 - Add the field 'sememeMembership' to the RestSememeVersion object.  Carries the set of concept sequences
    (that represent sememes) that the returned concept is a member of.  Added a query parameter to control the population to 
    both the 1/concept/version API and the 1/taxonomy/version API.  
    - Removed the expand options 'parents', 'children', 'countChildren', 'countParents' from the 1/concept/version API, 
    instead replacing these with query parameters, in a manner consistent with how they are specified in the 1/taxonomy/version API.  
* 2016/05/?? - 1.1 - A bunch of changes relating to stamp coordinate parsing and handling 
* 2016/04/22 - 1.0 - Introduction of version parameter.
